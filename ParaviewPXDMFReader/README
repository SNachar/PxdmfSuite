PREREQUISITES

 - The plugging requires Paraview version 4.4.0 or higher and a working compiler. 
 - Blas (for faster reconstruction)
 - zlib  to read compressed gmsh files
 - latex for the automatic generation of Documentation

COMPILATION

 For questions about how to build ParaView Please visit www.paraview.org
  
 A) To build the plugin along Paraview Super Build
   
    - add this line to the CMakeList.txt of the Paraview SuperBuild (around line 280 ) :

include(pxdmfreader)

    - add these lines to the versions.cmake : 

add_customizable_revision(pxdmfreader
      SVN_REPOSITORY "https://svn.ec-nantes.fr/ecn/PGDEV/trunk/ParaviewPXDMFReader/"
      SVN_USERNAME  fbordeu
      SVN_PASSWORD  fivt5JXA
      SVN_TRUST_CERT 1)


    - copy these files 
       BuildFiles/pxdmfreader.cmake
       BuildFiles/intall_pxdmfreader.cmake make
      to the Project directory in the Superbuild sources

    - compile the ParaViewSuperbuild using CMake (you must activate the plugin using the -DENABLE_pxdmfreader=true)
 

 B) To build the Paraview PXDMF Reader using a Paraview build directory:

    - first create a build dir
	mkdir pxdmfReader_build

    - Then configure and compile

	cd pxdmfReader_build	
	
	ccmake -D ParaView_DIR=/dir/to/the/paraview/build/dir /dir/to/the/paraviewPXDMFReader/dir 
	or 
	cmake -D ParaView_DIR=/dir/to/the/paraview/build/dir /dir/to/the/paraviewPXDMFReader/dir 

	make	

DEBUGGING
 
 A) If plugin loading failed, try setting the PV_PLUGIN_DEBUG (export PV_PLUGIN_DEBUG=1)
 environment variable for all processes that you were trying to load the plugin on. 
 ParaView will then try to print verbose information about each step and causes for
 failure, as show below.
 
 To assist in debugging the creation of widgets on the Properties panel, one can set 
 the environment variable PV_DEBUG_PANELS. Whenever a new pqProxyWidget is created, it 
 will print out debugging text on the console as well as the ParaView Output Window. 

 Additionally, to debug the changes to the state of the Apply button, one can set the 
 environment variable PV_DEBUG_APPLY_BUTTON. 

 Then fill a bug report in http://bug-mptc.ec-nantes.fr/

 B) For verification of the plugin type "make check" to compile and run all the test for 
 the plugin. 

KNOW BUGS:

- Incompatibility of cell data and 1D CoRectMesh.
  (To bypass, on must use unstructured 1D mesh.)

- custom axis label not working with paraview 4.4 . Also check the new edit axes grid... functions


TODO:
 
  Cleaning and documentation for all the filters
  Verify memory isn't leaking. Put Setxxx(0) in the destructors.
  Clean PXDMFWriter sources
  Clean PXDMFDocumentBaseStructure.cxx source

LICENSING AND BINARY DISTRIBUTION :

Q: About the binary version of the plug-in on the website:

 Hello, 

 I'm an researcher engineer at L'Ecole Centrale Nantes.

 In our laboratory we use Paraview in a daily basis. Paraview use QT with a =
 LGPL license.
 To treat the result of our research, we created a plugin for ParaView.
 The plugin is only a reader. it add a new filetype to ParaView.

 A will like to know if a can put the binary (not the sources) of the plugin=
  on a web page, so the community (partners Labs...) can benefits of our res=
 earch. Or we have  to buy a commercial license of QT?

 The binary is compatible with the binary version of Paraview (www.paraview.=
 org), so no compilation is needed from the end user.

 Thanks you,

A:

 Hello Mr. Bordeu,

 Thank you for your email.

 Regarding your licensing question, I believe you don't need to purchase a c=
 ommercial license in order to distribute the plugin you created.


 -          As a general rule, mixing Qt LGPL with commercial is not permitt=
 ed, therefore, if you started with the LGPL license it is better to keep th=
 e same license for the distribution of your solution.

 -          The LGPL license says that you should be able to share the Qt so=
 urce code with your recipients if they request it. So, as long as you can c=
 omply with the LGPL license restrictions, you don't need to switch commerci=
 al.

 Should you need further information, please feel free to contact me.

 Best regards/Bien cordialement,

 Veronica
